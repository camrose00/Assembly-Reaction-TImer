# Assembly-Reaction-Timer
This demo uses a stm32f49 disco board with a user push button and red and green LEDs.  
Once the red LED turns off, and the green LED turns on, the time until the user push button is pressed is recorded.  
Once the user pushes the button, the LEDs are reset and the reaction time printed to the display.
